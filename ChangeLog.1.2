    * lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl:
          Remove debugging.

2009-09-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/installkit.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstaller on Windows would sometimes fail to
          delete the uninstall.exe which would cause an empty directory error.
          
          Fixed a bug where the uninstaller would pop up an error message
          after finishing if the machine had host scripting disabled.


2009-09-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Binaries/FreeBSD-x86/xdg-utils, Binaries/Linux-x86/xdg-utils,
      lib/packages/xdg-utils, lib/packages/xdg-utils/xdg-desktop-icon,
      lib/packages/xdg-utils/xdg-desktop-menu,
      lib/packages/xdg-utils/xdg-icon-resource,
      lib/packages/xdg-utils/xdg-mime, lib/packages/xdg-utils/xdg-open:
          Fixed a bug where desktop icons were not being created on the
          Linux-x86_64 platform.
          Fixed a bug where desktop icons created when installing as root
          could not be read by a normal user.
          Fixed a bug where desktop icons need to be created with the
          executable bit set for some platforms and window managers.


2009-09-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where clicking the delete button in the virtual text tab
          would not delete the virtual text currently being edited.
          
          Added a Control-click to the virtual text table to select a row for
          deletion without editing the contents.
          
          Added a Shift-click to the virtual text table to select multiple
          rows within the table for deletion.


2009-09-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the Default to System Language property was not
          being saved in the installer, so the value was ignored.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/pl.msg, lib/msgs/installer/pl.msg:
          Fixed the display of Polish language strings in the installer and
          uninstaller.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/cs.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/cs.msg,
      lib/msgs/installer/cs.msg, lib/msgs/languages.txt:
          Added Czech translations (thanks to Kamil P?\195?\161ral!)


2009-09-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/CopyFiles.pane, lib/new.tcl:
          Changed the title of the default silent actions and the main install
          action on the Copy Files pane to better represent what is going on
          when reading the tree.


2009-09-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/FileActions/CreateFileLink.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Create File Link action where the order of the
          link and its target were accidentally reversed on non-Windows
          platforms.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where toggling components in certain cases could cause
          an error.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added new <%InstallStartupDir%> and <%UninstallStartupDir%> virtual
          text variables that contain the directory the (un)installer was
          launched from.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where attempting to focus on a browse entry widget would
          focus on nothing when it should focus on the browse button.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ar.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/ca.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/de.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/en.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/es.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/fr.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/hu.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/it.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/lt.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/nl.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/pl.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/ru.msg:
          Changed the wording of the Yes and No buttons on the license pane. 
          They were a holdover from the Classic Wizard, and the text doesn't
          make sense in the context of the new pane.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new WizardAPI API call.
          
          Fixed a bug where if the last pane of a wizard was conditional, the
          wizard could end up displaying a blank pane at the end instead of
          exiting when the wizard moved forward.

    * lib/commandline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing the long description of a command-line
          option would fail in an error.

    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action:
          Added a new Description property to the Create Windows Service
          action that will allow the action to specify a description of the
          service being created.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fix a bug where the failure focus code can cause errors when there
          is no pane currently displayed.  Not sure if this bug ever affected
          any users, but I hit it while playing around in the uninstaller.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Added titles to the default console actions to give a better idea of
          what's going on when looking at them in the tree.


2009-08-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where writing out script properties in project files
          could make them end up very difficult to read.  This changes the way
          object properties are written for anyone manipulating project files
          by hand.


2009-08-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/SetInstallPassword.action,
      lib/installapi.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where encrypted installers would not install files
          correctly on non-Windows platforms.
          Added a new SetInstallPassword API.


2009-08-24  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action:
          Fixed a bug where Add Directory to Path on non-Windows systems could
          mangle the PATH environment variable after executing.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make sure our bin/ directory is before the system directories in the
          PATH.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Removed more hard-coded English strings from the uninstaller.  They
          still require translation for other languages, but they're no longer
          hard-coded into the code.

    * lib/edit.tcl:
          Made it possible to copy-and-paste objects between two different
          instances of InstallJammer.

    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/GetJavaProperty.action, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new PropertyFileAPI API call to handle reading .properties
          files.
          
          Rewrote the Get Java Property action to use the new API.


2009-08-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed a selection bug in the choose directory dialog.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added new <%Tolower string%> and <%Toupper string%> virtual text.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fix a typo in the read-only save message.

    * lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl, lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Removed the "Install Error" and "Exit Setup" hard-coded English
          strings and added new virtual text in the English message catalog to
          replace them.


2009-08-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * installjammer, lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the selection in the entry of the choose directory
          dialog would incorrectly highlight the directory.

    * installjammer, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the builder would not run propertly on x86_64
          Linux machines.

    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where specifying a password did not encrypt separate
          archives when in Build Separate Archives mode.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Install UNIX Shortcut action did not offer the
          Command Line Arguments property even though it was supposed by other
          actions.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Fix a bug in the Execute External Program action where terminals
          taken from the TERM environment variable could fail because of the
          hard-coded -t title option.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where building Windows installers on non-Windows
          platforms could result in symlinks being packaged incorrectly as
          links and not followed as files.


2009-08-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where --version on non-Windows platforms would error
          out.
          
          Fixed a bug where the "can create" operator in the File Test
          condition was reporting incorrectly on non-Windows platforms.

    * Binaries/Windows/twapi/shell.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that removed the hidden value for the Window State
          property of the Install Windows Shortcut action.


2009-07-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.13 RELEASED ***


2009-07-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Dump a full stack trace on errors.  The change was made so that
          error messages wouldn't look as ugly to the end-user, but it only
          ends up obscuring the real message when people inevitably paste it
          into the forum for help.  I need the full stack trace to track
          things down.

    * docs/InstallJammer User Guide.pdf, docs/InstallJammer.chm,
      docs/html/FHSearch.js, docs/html/ReleaseNotes.html:
          Update docs for release.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version to 1.2.13 for release.


2009-07-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Conditions/UserInputConditions/AskYesOrNo.condition:
          Fix a bug in the Ask Yes or No condition that would cause an error
          in silent mode.


2009-06-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the last commit.


2009-06-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.13b7 RELEASED ***


2009-06-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * docs/InstallJammer User Guide.pdf, docs/InstallJammer.chm,
      docs/html/ApplicationInformation.html,
      docs/html/Command-LineOptions.html, docs/html/DebuggingAnInstall.html,
      docs/html/FHSearch.js, docs/html/GroupsAndFiles.html,
      docs/html/PlatformInformation.html, docs/html/ReleaseNotes.html:
          Update documentation.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the new setup type handling in console mode.
          
           Cleaned up the --help output a little bit for a more UNIX-y style.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version to 1.2.13b6 for release.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl:
          Made some changes to the progress output during a console install
          (thanks to C. W. for the tips).  It should be a lot cleaner now and
          look a little nicer.

    * lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl, lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where clicking in the virtual text table could sometimes
          jump to another part of the table if another field was already being
          edited.
          
           Made some general bug fixes and behavior tweaks to the virtual text
          table.

    * lib/conditions.tcl, lib/editor.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where a modal dialog (like the conditions editor) could
          end up outside of the viewing area when switching from larger to
          smaller monitors.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version to 1.2.13b7 for release.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Ask the object for its ID.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Move the API Call debug logging messages under level 2 logging. 
          They clutter up the standard log too much.


2009-06-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Create Windows Service action where an error
          would occur when installing a Shared Process service.

    * installjammer:
          Update the builder launch script to support Cygwin and MinGW on
          Windows.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          When looking for <%WINDOWS%>, trust %SystemRoot% more than %windir%.
           SystemRoot is a newer variable and probably more reliable while
          windir was used on old 95/98 systems and is left in place for
          compatibility.  Previously, when resolving <%WINDOWS%>, windir was
          trusted over SystemRoot, and this seems to be the wrong order of
          things.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the .installjammer directory was being created on
          startup when it didn't need to be.  This would cause some
          command-line builds to fail when built by a user who doesn't have a
          home directory.  The directory is now created only when the builder
          goes to save its preference settings.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Don't save a project preference file if there's nothing to save.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          If a preferences file exists in the root InstallJammer directory,
          store the preferences for that installation in that file instead of
          creating a directory on the system.  This will allow InstallJammer
          to run as a portable app and save its configuration back to its
          original location each time it's run.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/MessageBox.action,
      lib/Actions/GeneralActions/MessagePanel.action:
          Fixed a bug in Message Box and Message Panel that would allow them
          to execute in a console or silent install and then throw an error. 
          These actions will no longer execute in a console or silent install.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Make a better attempt at recognizing *.msg files that belong to
          InstallJammer and are valid message catalogs instead of just blindly
          loading any *.msg file we come across next to the project file.
          
           Fixed a bug where InstallJammer would attempt to load any *.msg
          file sitting next to the project file when loading the project.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateSetupTypes.action, lib/install.tcl,
      lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where using the keyboard to navigate setup types would
          not change the description as one was selected.
          
           Fixed a bug where the SetActiveSetupType API call would not change
          the active setup type selected on the screen if the Setup Type pane
          was visible.


2009-06-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:
          Remove the check for administrator on Windows XP.  This code isn't
          ready yet, there are too many false negatives.  The Require
          Administrator privilege will currently only affect Vista and beyond.


2009-06-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would cause shortcuts not to work on Asian versions
          of Windows.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Give a better error message when a newer project file is loaded into
          an older version of InstallJammer.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          A fix for environment variables on UNIX.  Still need to test.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where failing to load a project would corrupt the
          builder and require it to be restarted to load another project.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstaller would remove ALL environment
          variables added by an installer on UNIX, even the ones marked not to
          be removed.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstaller would not properly default to the
          language chosen during installation for some of the available
          languages.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added some debugging to a few API calls.


2009-06-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the handling of directories in the builder.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ca.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/es.msg,
      lib/msgs/installer/ca.msg, lib/msgs/installer/es.msg,
      lib/msgs/languages.txt, lib/packages/InstallJammer/lang/ca.rc:
          Cleanup Spanish translations and add Catal?\195?\131 translations
          (thanks to Marc Lerma!).

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/lt.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/lt.msg,
      lib/msgs/installer/lt.msg, lib/msgs/languages.txt:
          Added Lithuanian translations (thanks to Jonas Jasas!).


2009-06-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Moved the debug log in the builder to a --debug-log command-line
          option that is disabled by default.  We only need the debugging when
          something is broken in the builder, so we don't need to do it on
          every startup.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Added the ability to span multiple discs using build separate
          archives.


2009-06-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/header.tcl:
          Fix a bug on non-Windows platforms introduced in the last beta that
          caused installers to fail on startup.


2009-06-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fix a typo so that Save Files doesn't show up in file properties,
          only directories.


2009-06-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.13b5 RELEASED ***


2009-06-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/commandline.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a debug option for uninstallers for new projects.

    * lib/commandline.tcl:
          Fix wording on debug option.


2009-06-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Change to the temp directory before uninstall.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fix a bug where new code broke command-line builds.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Ugh.  Remove debugging.


2009-06-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Changed the way the uninstall handles the deletion of the
          uninstaller itself.  The uninstaller now gets renamed into the temp
          directory instead of launching a copy of itself.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXProgramFolder.action,
      lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action,
      lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/common.tcl:
          Replace the restart of the gnome-panel.  Some versions of the panel
          still require a restart to pick up menu changes, and until I can
          determine what versions need it and what don't, we'll err on the
          side of just doing it.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Don't do the Require Administrator check on Vista since we're
          already compiled with a version of the installkit that requires
          administrator privileges before starting.  That's good enough
          without needing the extra check.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where zip and tar archives weren't picking up any files
          during a build.  Also cleaned up when and how a refresh of the file
          groups is done so that it isn't done redundantly.


2009-06-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/header.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Vista would inaccurately report that a directory
          was writable when it wasn't.


2009-05-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall would default to the system language
          when it should keep the language used during installation.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl:
          A couple of tweaks to make it possible to add files to an installer
          mid-install.  This can be used to add files from, say, a CDROM as
          part of the installer, and they just get copied over with the rest.

2009-05-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/new.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl,
      lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Added new Ignore Files and Ignore Directories project preferences. 
          These two properties allow a project to specify patterns of files
          and directories to ignore when searching the filesystem.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Add a check to see if the Require Administrator property on Windows
          has changed and force a full rebuild if it has.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2009-05-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Fixed a bug where newer Gnome terminals would ignore more than one
          command when executing an external action in a console.  Any command
          executed in a console is now stored in a file and then executed as a
          script.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe, Binaries/Windows/installkitA.exe,
      Binaries/Windows/installkitU.exe, Binaries/Windows/installkitUA.exe,
      installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:
          Fixed a bug from beta 1 where command-line arguments in the builder
          were being ignored when testing on Windows.


2009-05-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug where execute action tries to cd back to a directory that
          no longer exists.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where several APIs would cause an error if executed in
          silent mode.  These APIs are now restricted to GUI-only code.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where recursive directory links could cause an infinite
          loop in the builder.
           Added a new Follow Directory Links property to file groups.  This
          matches the Follow File Links property but for directories instead
          of files.  The default is Yes for backward compatibility.


2009-05-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening an explorer windows on UNIX platforms
          could fail.


2009-05-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl, lib/BWidget/choosefile.tcl:

          Fixed a bug that caused non-Windows installs to fail.
          
          Display the directory in a Select Destination pane properly but
          leave the actual virtual text alone.

          New binaries for Windows.  This commit includes separate binaries
          for installers that require administrator privileges on Vista as
          well as true uncompressed versions of the installkits.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where launching an admin installer on Vista would fail.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/main.tcl,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Added a new Require Administrator option to the Windows platform.
          
           Added a new Use Uncompressed Binaries option to the Windows
          platform.
          
           Added a new RequireAdministratorText virtual text to the English
          message catalog.  This message will appear when the user doesn't
          have the required administrator privileges.

    * lib/class.tcl:
          Make the default for Require Administrator be true to be backward
          compatible with previous releases.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Launch admin uninstallers properly on Vista.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWrappedScript.action:
          Added a new Installkit property to the Install Wrapped Script
          action.

          Reverting to a new version of the old TWAPI.  This is TWAPI version
          1.1.5, which should contain everything we need as well as not having
          a bunch of stuff we don't.  It's also been compiled without a
          dependence on MSVCP.DLL, which means it should play nice on Windows
          2000 boxes where that DLL is not standard.

    * Binaries/Windows/twapi/twapi.tcl:
          Use our own load command to load twapi.dll.

2009-04-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a regression that caused installs to fail on non-Windows
          platforms.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXProgramFolder.action,
      lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action,
      lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/common.tcl:
          Installing UNIX shortcuts as root will not install them for all
          users and not for the root user.  This does not count for desktop
          icons, only for program folders and shortcuts.
          
           Removed the code to restart the gnome-panel on Gnome desktops.  It
          seems like the panel will automatically pick up the changes on its
          own now.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the default system language was not getting picked
          up properly on some Windows systems.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a typo in ij_chooseDirectory.
          
          When passing -title and -message to a native dialog, we want -title
          to use the value of -message because -title is the argument native
          Tk dialogs expect.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new ConfigAPI API call to configure internal settings.

          Roll back to TWAPI 2.0.12, which is the most recent stable release
          to see if we can fix the crashes on some Windows machines.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed a bug with the choose directory dialog on Vista where it was
          still looking for My Documents even though Vista just calls it
          Documents.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where trying to launch explorer in a directory on Vista
          would just open the explorer to the My Computer screen.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Use an even better way to explore a directory.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where tar and zip archives did not auto refresh files
          when the Refresh File List Before Building preference was turned on.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/CreateFileLink.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Create File Link action where it would fail on
          UNIX systems if the link target did not already exist.  This will
          remain a requirement for Windows platforms however.

          Changed the arguments for the ResponseFileAPI and CommandLineAPI.
          
           Fixed a bug where the system language might not get used even when
          the message catalog is compiled into the installer.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:
          When a user widget is destroyed, make sure we unset its ID from the
          UserWidgets array.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/DestroyWidget.action, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Renamed the -widget argument in the DestroyWidget API to -widgets to
          reflect that a list of widgets must be passed.


2009-04-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/new.tcl:
          Added a new Default To System Language install feature to specify
          that the default language on the installing system should be used if
          it exists within the installer's message catalog.  Otherwise, the
          Default Language will be used.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/DestroyWidget.action, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Make the DestroyWidget API take a proper list.  APIs should always
          take proper lists from now on, and the actions will be responsible
          for splitting on ;.


2009-04-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Conditions/FileConditions/FilePermissionCondition.condition:
          Added new permissions to the File Permission Condition.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Added new <%ErrorFiles%> and <%ErrorDirs%> virtual text that are set
          during uninstallation when it fails to remove files or directories.


2009-04-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Execute External Program action where the
          Progressive Output Widget could not be found when the action was
          nested in an action group.
          
           In most properties, widgets can now be specified as <pane>.<widget>
          to specify exactly which pane and widget is meant.


2009-04-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Don't allow "all" as an alias.  It is now reserved.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/de.msg, Themes/Classic_Wizard/en.msg,

      lib/msgs/installer/pt_br.msg:
          Cleaned up all of the message catalogs to remove double spaces when
          displaying text in some panes.  These extra spaces were part of the
          actual message catalog and not a bug in the installers.


2009-04-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where some actions (like WriteTextToFile) that log files
          would error out when running inside of an uninstaller.


2009-04-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing some text fields would not cause the
          project to become modified.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where setting Windows file attributes on a non-Windows
          platform would then cause an error during installation.


2009-04-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXProgramFolder.action,
      lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Added a new Install UNIX Program Folder action to allow creating
          program folders with more options like icons.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXProgramFolder.action:
          Make Install UNIX Program Folder install a dummy .desktop file
          alongside the directory so that we can properly uninstall it later.


2009-04-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the new move to pane code that would cause panes with
          no actions to not move at all.  Oops.

    * lib/Actions/WindowsActions/DisableWow64Redirection.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsActions/RevertWow64Redirection.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the new wow64 redirection code where the signal
          wasn't getting passed to the unpack thread, so it didn't really mean
          a whole lot.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Quick fix to allow user-added text boxes to be appended to without
          clearing them.


2009-04-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          The wizard move actions will now stop any further actions from
          continuing.  This was previously fixed but not completely.  This fix
          should be complete.


2009-03-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Conditions/PlatformConditions/PlatformCondition.condition,
      lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Platform Condition where not all platforms were
          available.
          
           Added new "matches" and "does not match" operators to the Platform
          Condition.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/AddResponseFileInfo.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateSetupTypes.action, lib/common.tcl,
      lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl, lib/main.tcl,
      lib/new.tcl:
          Added the ability to enable response files for installers.  Response
          files let a user save their responses from an install and replay
          them in another install later.
          
           Added a new Enable Response Files install feature.  This will be
          true by default in projects using version 1.2.13 and higher.
          
           Added a new Add Response File Info action to enable adding virtual
          text to a response file when they are enabled.
          
           Made the SelectedComponents virtual text writable.  Whenever this
          virtual text is changed, it will overwrite the current set of
          selected components.
          
           Added a new ComponentAPI API call.
          
           Added a new CommandLineAPI API call.
          
           Added a new ResponseFileAPI API call.


2009-03-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

      lib/Actions/WindowsActions/DisableWow64Redirection.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsActions/RevertWow64Redirection.action:
          New Windows binary.
          
           Added a new Disable / Revert Wow64 Redirection and action to
          disable Windows 64 bit filesystem redirection.


2009-03-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action:
          Fix a bug in the Locate Java Runtime action to actually let it take
          advantage of the new version compare code.
          
           The Locate Java Runtime action now includes a full version number
          in the <%JavaAvailableVersions%> virtual text.
          
           Added a new <%JavaVersionMinor%> that is set by the Locate Java
          Runtime action.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Let versions also split on -.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall would error on exit while trying to
          execute the cleanup .bat file.
          
          Fixed a bug in the uninstaller where it was trying to use a variable
          called info(Dir), which was the wrong variable.  This resulted in an
          "invalid variable" error when the uninstall went to remove
          everything.


2009-03-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action,
      lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Execute External Program action where watching
          for output to the Status virtual text could cause an infinite loop
          error.


2009-03-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallLeftoverFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug where Uninstall Leftover Files was failing on console
          installs.

    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action, lib/common.tcl:
          The Locate Java Runtime action now substitutes virtual text properly
          in the search path.  Also added some debugging to see where the
          action is looking for Java on the system.
          
           The Locate Java Runtime action now handles Java versions properly,
          so you can use a version like 1.6.0_10 as a minimum or maximum. 
          Previously, the version after the _ was invalid.


2009-02-24  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallDesktopShortcut.action,
      lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action,
      lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Added a new Vendor ID to the UNIX shortcut actions to allow for
          shortcuts to be grouped together under a particular vendor.  This
          makes it easy for multiple installers to create shortcuts in the
          same program folders.


2009-02-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where actions after a Move Forward or Move to Pane
          action would still be executed when they should be skipped.


2009-02-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where icons and menus were not being properly removed
          during uninstall on the Linux platform.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/FocusOnWidget.action:
          The Focus on Widget action should now work for built-in widgets as
          well, not just ones added with an Add Widget action.


2009-02-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that broke solid compression builds on all platforms.

    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where using an install password would fail due to a
          missing function.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug when running multiple installers and closing a child
          installer would delete the temporary directory out from under the
          parent.

    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Locate Java Runtime action where it would attempt
          to prompt the user with a dialog in a console install.  For now,
          there is no prompt for the user in a console install, it is simply
          ignored.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Modify Widget action could end up clearing a
          text widget even if no text was specified.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          Remove debugging stuff.


2009-01-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Re-fix a bug with the uninstall VBS script that was accidentally
          removed.


2009-01-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/class.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Added a new Save Files property to file groups and directories to
          allow for finer-grained access to the Save Only Toplevel Directories
          project preference.


2009-01-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/AddInstallInfo.action,
      lib/Actions/InstallActions/GetPreviousInstallInfo.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new Application ID property to the Get Previous Install Info
          action.
          
           Added a new ReadInstallInfo API.
          
           Added a new AddInstallInfo API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Added a new PreviousInstallIDs virtual text that is set after
          reading previous install info.


2009-01-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl, lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug with the new build log change when building from the
          command-line.
          
          Fix a bug with the installkit being used to cleanup after an
          uninstall.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fix several bugs in the final uninstall process.  UNIX will now use
          a shell script, and Windows will probably go back to the VB script
          whenever possible.  That will be done tomorrow though.
          
           Fixed a bug where a file group's size was not accurate when
          following
          symlinks since the size of the file that was linked to was never
          calculated.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Hopefully the last change to the uninstall cleanup.  Windows will
          now check for the existence of wscript on the system, and if it is
          there, use it.  Otherwise, drop an installkit in the temp directory
          and cleanup from there.


2009-01-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/help.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Change the way the Build Version is calculated so that it is always
          unique with every hourly build.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/main.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a new --build-log-file command-line option to the install
          builder.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fix a some typos from the last commit.
          
           Doing a full build (not quick) now automatically jumps to the build
          screen before the build begins to show the log.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          The Modify Widget action should now properly handle textboxes when
          modifying the text property.


2009-01-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fix a typo.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/DestroyWidget.action, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new DestroyWidget API call.
          
           The Destroy Widget action can now take a list of widgets separated
          by ;.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where tar and zip archives with no files would error
          with a big, ugly error message.  It's a little more graceful now.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          InstallDirSuffix can now contain more than a single directory, and
          the whole string will be joined with the InstallDir anytime it is
          changed.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action, lib/class.tcl,
      lib/install.tcl:
          Added a new Selectable property to Components that, if false, will
          turn a component in the component tree into a header with no check
          or radio button.


2009-01-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where upgrade installers were not being included as part
          of the original install during uninstall because of a mismatch in
          the registry info.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/RebootOrShutdownSystem.action, lib/build.tcl,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/header.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl,
      lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed several bugs related to installers running under WINE. 
          Installers and uninstallers should now run successfully under WINE.
          
           Fixed a bug in the Reboot or Shutdown System action for UNIX
          systems where no time was specified.
          
           Fixed a bug in uninstall on HP-UX.  All platforms now perform the
          same uninstall that was previously reserved for Windows.  Which is
          to say that the uninstaller is copied off to a temporary location
          before executing it so that the original uninstaller can be deleted
          in place.
          
           Fixed a bug that would affect launching installers that launch
          other installers where the child installer would delete the
          temporary directory out from under the parent, leaving the parent to
          error out.


2009-01-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/theme.cfg:
          Added NONE as an option for buttons on a pane.


2009-01-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl, lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Made the text in the language selection dialog part of the English
          message catalog instead of a hard-coded value.


2009-01-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Binaries/Linux-x86/xdg-utils/xdg-desktop-icon:
          Fixed a bug where creating desktop shortcuts on Linux Gnome desktops
          would fail if the desktop directory was not called Desktop, as it is
          on non-English systems.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall on Windows would leave a hanging
          process after exiting.  This would cause problems when the
          uninstaller was called from some other program.


2009-01-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/buttonbox.tcl, lib/BWidget/dialog.tcl,
      lib/BWidget/messagedlg.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in message dialogs where the X button on the window
          would do nothing.
          
           Fixed a bug in message dialogs where the initial focus button was
          not correct.

    * lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing a virtual text string from the editor
          would not save when the editor closed.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe, installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:
          New binaries for Windows.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Launch Web Browser action would not work
          properly on some versions of Windows.


2008-12-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where passing /version to an uninstaller would cause an
          error.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the UNIX permissions were being flipped in the
          builder.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the uninstaller that can occur on Windows systems where
          the .vbs file extension is messed up in the registry.

2008-11-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Uninstall Selected Files action that would
          sometimes occur when using the Remove from Uninstall action.


2008-11-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would only occur on some Windows system where a
          permission denied error would appear on startup.
          
          Removed the installkit build from threaded Windows.  This used to be
          necessary when the installkit build was much slower and IJ itself
          was slower in general.  This is no longer the case, and the
          installkit is built without even a blink.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where <%Platform%> was not expanded in the name of
          archive files.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where passing /help as an argument to an installer on
          Windows would show a message box with the title "In-Valid Argument."


2008-11-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action:
          Code cleanup

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Add Directory to Path and Add Environment Variable will now also
          make the same change to the running installer's environment.

    * lib/BWidget/optiontree.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where double-clicking a check box in an option tree
          would cause the check button to toggle twice, but the command
          wouldn't fire.  This leaves some components in the wrong state.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where going back-and-forth between a custom setup
          component screen could leave the components in an unknown state.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Code cleanup.

2008-11-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/dynhelp.tcl:
          Set a max width for help balloons so they don't get too big on the
          screen.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Cleanup a help balloon message.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Added a new Follow File Links property to file groups.  This
          property tells InstallJammer whether to include file links as files
          or links when building.


2008-11-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Binaries/HPUX-hppa/installkit:
          New HPUX binary.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make the default exit code empty so it will use a default based on
          the user interaction.
          
          Fix a bug where any message box in the builder would fail.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a -exitcode option the Exit API.
           Fixed a bug in the GetWidgetPath API where it would get the path of
          an enclosing frame instead of the real widget if a widget was added
          with a label.
           Added a new RollbackInstall API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Exit with a decent exit code if one was never given to us.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action:
          Fixed bugs in the Exit and Move Forward actions that were caused by
          the new exit code capabilities.  They now both call the proper Exit
          API.


2008-11-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the CopyObject API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where required components could be unchecked by their
          parent if the parent was unchecked.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.com, Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe,
      Binaries/Windows/installkitU.exe, installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:
          New Windows binaries.

      Binaries/HPUX-hppa/tkdnd1.0:
          Removed AIX, FreeBSD 4, FreeBSD 5 and HPUX as builder platforms. 
          This does not mean these platforms are no longer supported.  It
          means they are no longer supported as GUI builder platforms.  They
          also do not support LZMA compression when building on these
          platforms.

2008-11-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new CopyObject API call.


2008-11-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Add Widget action could be executed from an
          action group with no pane as its parent.  This would cause a "bad
          window" error.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Uninstall Leftover Files action

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where specifying Categories in the Additional Arguments
          of the Install UNIX Shortcut action would cause an error instead of
          working like it should.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where it was impossible to post a message box in a
          silent install.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Launch Web Browser action where an & in the URL
          would truncate the URL.  This was due to Windows' command-line
          parsing rules.  The new method is to create a URL shortcut in the
          temp directory and then invoke that shortcut to launch the browser.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where error messages in a command-line build were not
          output to stderr as they should be.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReplaceTextInFile.action,
      lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Added a new Encoding property to the Replace Text in File and Write
          Text to File actions.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Editable text widgets now tab to the next widget when hitting Tab
          instead of inserting a tab in the text box.  A Control-Tab can be
          used to insert a tab if it's really necessary.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make Shift-Tab work on text widgets too.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Wait.action:
          Make the Wait action do an update before sleeping.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AppendTextToWidget.action:
          Added a new Append Text to Widget action.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action, lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl,
      lib/installapi.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Added a new SetExitCode API.
           Added a new Exit Code property to the Exit action.


2008-10-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed several bugs in the build of zip and tar files.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where silent install would still show a progress bar.


2008-10-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Try to cleanup open file handles on exit.


2008-10-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Install Windows Shortcut action that would
          prevent it from creating a URL shortcut.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Encode URL API.  The entire URL was being
          encoded, which would percent-encode the hostname as well as the
          query, which is the wrong thing to do.


2008-10-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the new split archives code that was causing split
          archives not to work on non-Windows platforms.


2008-10-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Fix a bug where larger installs would fail even on 64 bit systems.

    * lib/cmdline.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where variables defined on the command-line were being
          defined after the control script.  The control script should have
          access to the correct values.
           Fixed a bug where setting platform variables from the command-line
          would not be set properly.  Passing -DExecutable, for example, works
          now.
           The special platforms "tar" and "zip" are now acceptable as
          platforms to enable the tar and zip archive targets.


2008-10-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.10b1 RELEASED ***


2008-10-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Make the console progress bar more generic and let the uninstall use
          it.

    * docs/InstallJammer User Guide.pdf, docs/InstallJammer.chm,
      docs/html/128.html, docs/html/129.html, docs/html/FHKeywords.html,
      docs/html/FHSearch.js, docs/html/FHTocTab.js,
      docs/html/ReleaseNotes.html:
          Update documentation.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-10-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/License.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/CopyFiles.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/License.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Uninstall/Uninstall.pane:
          Fixed a bug where the default actions to modify button states on the
          License and Copy Files panes were happening after the pane had been
          displayed, which would give the user time to quickly zip by them
          before the buttons were changed.  This change only affects new
          projects.  Older projects will have to be modified to fix this bug.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl, lib/file.tcl,
      lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a new Build Separate Archives property to all platforms.  This
          property allows installers to be built with files being separate
          archives that are mounted on startup.  This means that the
          installers are no longer one single executable, but it makes it
          possible to avoid some size limitations on 32 bit platforms.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where file installation would sometimes not reach 100%.
           Added a new progress bar for console installs.  A new Show Console
          Progress property was added to the Install Selected Files action
          which is enabled by default.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/cmdline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error during a command-line build would not
          exit with an error code.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          If the project is ignoring missing files, the installer should not
          exit on an error for a missing file.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where symlink'd files were being included in the
          installer instead of a link to the file being created on the target
          machine.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Move to Pane could not select a pane from the
          uninstall.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the Move Forward and Move to Pane actions would
          still execute any remaining actions on the current pane after moving
          forward.  Moving now means that any actions after the move are not
          executed.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Added a new Clear Progressive Widget property to the Execute
          External Program action to specify whether the progressive output
          widget should be cleared before the program exits.  The default is
          Yes, which was the previous behavior.


2008-10-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an installer that specifically did not allow
          language selection could still get English if the system language
          was such.  This should be addressed further in another version.


2008-10-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the new error handling that would cause an error to
          always happen during installation for some platforms.


2008-09-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Locate Java Runtime action was not accurately
          picking up the paths from the Windows registry.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fix typo.


2008-09-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * README.txt:
          Remove mention of sourceforge from the README.


2008-09-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          An error during file installation now produces a simple error
          message instead of a detailed error.  <%InstallErrors%> contains the
          full error message.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Fixed a bug where Add Directory to Path would fail for .cshrc when
          the variable didn't already exist.

          properties.


2008-09-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

          being propagated to the uninstaller correctly.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing text properties for languages with a space
          in the name (like Brazilian Portuguese) failed to save the edited
          text correctly.


2008-09-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause an error in the builder after

    * Binaries/Windows/craplzma0.1/craplzma01.dll,
      Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe:
          New Windows binaries.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Install Program Folder Shortcut action where
          specifying a subfolder in the folder name would be ignored, and the
          icon would just be installed in the root program folder.

          New installkit binaries for Windows.


2008-09-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/common.tcl,
      lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error during file installation would show an
          error popup and then just freeze with no way to cancel the
          installer.  The error is now returned up the stack to the Install
          Selected Files action where it can be handled.  This also adds a new
          <%InstallErrors%> virtual text that contains the error message from
          the unpack process.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Add Environment Variable action on Windows where
          the path in the registry would not get expanded for some reason.

          New Linux-x86 binaries.


2008-09-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall process would error if no
          directories were being removed.


2008-08-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/commandline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where building from the command-line would still include
          debug options even when building for release. (thanks to John
          Bratteli for the fix).


2008-08-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall could exit with an error on cleanup
          when being executed from another uninstall.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Windows exe information was not being substituted
          for virtual text when the installer is built.
           Added a new Install Executable Description property to Windows that
          is used as the File Description in the exe properties.  This
          defaults to what it has always been: <%AppName%> <%Version%> Setup.

    * lib/BWidget/properties.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/new.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing the Install Version would cause it to roll
          back to 1.0.0.0 each time.
           Fixed a bug where the version variables derived from InstallVersion
          were not being set properly.  Passing version information on the
          command-line should also work as expected now.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2.9 RELEASED ***


2008-08-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug introduced in 1.2.8 where an install registry would not
          get cleaned up properly.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where cleaning up a canceled install could cause errors
          and freeze the installer under certain conditions.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug where an uninstaller would sometimes report that a
          directory could not be removed because it was not empty when it
          actually was.  This fix now means that directories are not
          necessarily removed in the same order they were installed.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-08-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a possible error case when attempting to set file permissions on
          a file that doesn't exist.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where stopping an install might still try to execute
          some further code after things had stopped.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Revert those last two changes in favor of the proper fix.


2008-08-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error in an action would not get propagated up
          to show an error message.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where a message box in an uninstaller could fail and
          hang without an error.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an uninstall that did not have permissions would
          attempt to do a lot of things that just weren't possible.  The
          uninstall should fail gracefully now and give the user proper error
          messages.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2.8 RELEASED ***


2008-08-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action:
          Fix a bug where the Display Name property was being ignored in the
          Create Windows Service action.


2008-08-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where loading a corrupted preferences file would cause a
          crash.  A corrupted preferences file should just be deleted.

    * lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action,
      lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsolePause.action, lib/common.tcl:
          All calls to the external stty command are now wrapped in a catch to
          prevent failures.  This doesn't mean that stty won't fail, it just
          means that InstallJammer won't fail as a result of it.  This could
          mean that some console actions do not work as expected on some
          systems, but the errors seem to be very limited to a small number of
          machines.

    * ANNOUNCE.txt:
          Update announcement.


2008-07-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the AND/OR operator for conditions was not
          propagated to temporary objects created during execution.

    * lib/BWidget/choosefile.tcl:
          Fix a bug where selecting a single file in a multi-select file
          chooser would fail if the file selected had a space in the path.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where a space in the command line of a UNIX shortcut
          would fail because the filename wasn't properly quoted.  Double
          quotes are now added around a command with spaces before writing out
          the shortcut file.


2008-07-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where duplicate directories could show up in file
          groups.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Fix a bug introduced in the last release.  Files in Write Text to
          File that are relative are made relative to the install dir as the
          docs correctly say.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          In debug mode, make the error messages from actions and conditions
          display more information about the error.


2008-07-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an empty pattern in some file actions would return
          the install directory.


2008-07-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * /installjammer/branches/installjammer-1.2 (from
      /installjammer/trunk:510):
          made a copy


2008-07-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing virtual text can sometimes cause a ::TMP
          error.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWrappedScript.action:
          Fix a bug where installing a wrapped script fails to substitute
          virtual text in Windows version information.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Fixed a bug where Write Text to File paths were relative to the
          current directory instead of the installdir.

    * lib/actions.tcl:
          The Value property was accidentally removed for several widget types
          in the Add Widget action properties frame.


2008-07-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.7 RELEASED ***


2008-07-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-07-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action, lib/actions.tcl,
      lib/class.tcl, lib/preview.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where moving an Add Widget action to another pane
          wouldn't actually change its preview parent, so clicking Preview
          Pane on the action would preview its old pane.
          
           Reworked the Add Widget action's properties page to separate
          type-specific properties into an Advanced Properties tab with the
          standard widget properties under a Widget Properties tab.
          
           Added a new File Types property to the Add Widget action for browse
          entry widgets.
          
           Added a new combobox widget type to the Add Widget action.
          
          Changed the text for the Validate Entry On property to Validate On
          since it now applies to more than just entries.  The internal
          property name is still ValidateEntryOn for compatibility.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/RemoveDirectoryFromPath.action,
      lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Added a new Separator property to the Add Directory to Path action.
          
           Added a new Separator property to the Remove Directory from Path
          action.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action:
          Added a new Normalize Paths property to the Add Directory to Path
          action.


2008-07-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action:
          Fixed a bug where building the uninstaller on some systems would
          build an uninstall that fails in GUI mode.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall could delete the Install Dir even if
          the installer was not the one who created it.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Setup Actions could error checking conditions.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where executing an action with an alias could end up
          deleting the alias, which would cause subsequent executions of that
          action by-alias to fail.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the new project wizard dialog was not modal.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where configuring some install or uninstall mode that
          did not exist would cause an error in the install.  Each will now
          use the standard mode if the given mode is bogus.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Release modality on close.


2008-06-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/new.tcl:
          Fix a nasty bug where clicking File -> New to create a new project
          does not close any open project and will instead overwrite the open
          project and blow it away.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where building from the command line would expose the
          Install Password in the Install Password pane during installation.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the order of UNIX file permissions.  The checkbuttons
          were in the correct order, but the code was not picking up the
          permissions in the correct order.  The read and execute bits were
          flipped.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Set correct default and cancel buttons for standard message dialogs.

    * lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/new.tcl, lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Added a new Preserve Windows File Attributes project preference.

2008-06-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fix a bug where modified files don't get updated in the unpack
          process, so changes to file objects never get noticed when unpacked.


2008-06-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Minor fixes.


2008-06-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

2008-06-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/init.tcl, Themes/Classic_Wizard/nl.msg:
          Fixed a bug in the classic wizard init that would cause it to fail.
          
           Fixed a missing quote in the Dutch translations for the Classic
          Wizard that would cause an error when creating a new project with
          this theme.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fix a bug where using \ in an image path can cause the image to get
          lost at runtime.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a nasty little bug where the File Update Method was not being
          respected for files being installed.  This would cause things like
          date checks to fail and overwrite modified, existing files.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/install.tcl,
      lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fix some integer overflows.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Remove debugging.


2008-06-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/class.tcl:
          All objects should answer component requests.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Conditions should inherit from TreeObject even if they are
          structured like a tree.  This makes conditions behave more like all
          other objects.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Use the old uninstall if it exists.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Add new Exit API.
          
          Fix bugs in a few API calls.


2008-05-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:
          Added some verbose output from the unpacker.

    * lib/header.tcl:
          Use strict numbers as booleans for the ::debug variable.

    * lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where canceling during installation would sometimes
          cause the process to freeze until killed.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added more functionality to the debugging command to allow for
          specifying whether you want to debug to the console or file or both.
          
           Fixed a bug where canceling during installation could cause an
          error because the unpack proceeds and tried to update a file that
          wasn't installed.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the new TWAPI shortcut generation where passing a
          blank target for the shortcut would cause an error.  If the target
          is empty, we just point it to C:/.


2008-05-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Unset the active components when closing a project so that they
          don't mess with any future projects that are loaded.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed several virtual text variables where there was a bug using the
          Normalize command within their procs.
          
          Fixed instances of using Normalize without fully qualifying the
          command.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:
          Added a new Validate Entry On property to the Add Widget action. 
          This will allow entry widgets to specify an action that is executed
          when certain events happen.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Install Windows Shortcut will now use TWAPI as its method of
          creating the shortcut when it is available.  This will fix the
          problems many people are having installing shortcuts on Asian
          character sets in Windows.

    * Binaries/Windows/craplzma0.1/craplzma01.dll:
          Committed the correct version of the LZMA library on Windows.  This
          will fix issues with building installers using LZMA compression on
          Windows.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.com, Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe,
      installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:
          New Windows binaries.

    * lib/trees.tcl:
          Remove some code that was probably intended to work when you
          couldn't drag-and-drop outside of the same parent node.  The
          drag-and-drop behavior now seems to be correct.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fix a few bugs with runtime image handling.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Added new GetWidgetChildren API to get the children of a widget.
          
          Added new ModifyWidget API to modify widgets like the Modify Widget
          action.
          
          Added new SetFileTypeEOL API to specify the end-of-line character to
          use for specific file types during installation.  This will
          auto-correct file line-endings for files by extension when used.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Set the minimum size for the choose directory dialog but don't
          explicitly specify the geometry.  This will allow it to expand for
          longer text strings but still maintain a minimum size.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common/CustomBlankPane1.tcl:
          Change the default background of the large image in Custom Blank
          Pane 1 to white.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/SelectProgramFolder.pane,
      lib/Conditions/FileConditions/FileNameTestCondition.condition,

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Modernized the choose directory dialog.  The label showing the

          text.
           Fixed a bug where changing the language would not update the
          install title with the appropriate title for the new language.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Several fixes to dialog transient parent handling and some new
          variables to control native dialogs.

2008-04-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Revert change where we included all languages.  The AddLanguage +
          LoadMessageCatalog APIs will take care of special cases.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix that allows the system language to always be the first one we
          check, followed by default language and finally English.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          We don't need to explicitly add English anymore.  It will be set as
          the last resort in the locale on all installers.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl:
          More fixes for getting the right preference order for locales.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/editor.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a new "All" language to text fields that will set all
          languages with the same message when used.  When retrieving text for
          the All language, text will only be retrieved if all languages have
          the same text.  Otherwise, the text is blank.


2008-04-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Cleaned up some issues with FindObjects.
          
          Made language and languagecode arguments case-insensitive when
          checking.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Added a link on the Help menu to the Support Forums.


2008-04-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Just include all languages in the installers.  The message catalogs
          aren't that big, and it helps to support the auto-detection.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Some fixes for OS X.


2008-04-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Try to fix the stupid window title bug on Solaris again.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ru.msg, lib/msgs/installer/ru.msg,
      lib/msgs/languages.txt, lib/packages/InstallJammer/lang/ru.rc:
          Adding Russian translations (thanks to Stanislav Borutsky

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ar.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/de.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/es.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/fr.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/hu.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/it.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/nl.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/pl.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/ru.msg:
          Removed the dummy test for Readma panes so that they don't display
          the wrong information in a language other than English.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          The order of Before Pane is Displayed actions and conditions has
          been reversed.  Previously, the actions would execute first, but
          this is the opposite of the way every other check works.  The
          conditions will now be checked before the pane is displayed, and if
          they fail, the wizard will move forward without ever executing the
          actions.
           Fixed a bug where the various move wizard actions would always move
          on step extra because the wizard was not noticing that the actions
          had moved forward.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/hu.msg:
          Fix typo in the Hungarian messages (thanks to tyuk!)

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Added some code to handle errors in the Windows build thread and
          output them properly to the log.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where not all languages would appear as choices in the
          builder.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new AddLanguage API call.

    * lib/conditions.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening the condition editor could cause
          copy-and-paste actions to not work anymore.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/hu.msg:
          Fixed typos in Hungarian translations.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Added new PromptForDirectoryNewFolderText virtual text to the
          English message catalog.  This is the default text for the Make New
          Folder button on the Choose Directory dialog.  Translations will be
          added as they become available.


2008-04-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug with the new auto-locale code.  We force English in the
          builder for now.
          Hopefully fixed a bug with the message box titles on some platforms.
           Fixed a typo in the <%FileGroup%> virtual text that caused an
          error.


2008-04-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Add a blank default Editor preference.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the message box code.


2008-04-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Dummying up some methods for compliance.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new -object option the SetVirtualText API.  This allows for
          setting virtual text on objects like panes and actions.
           Added new LoadMessageCatalog API.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Oops.  Left some debug code in.

    * lib/main.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Some quick fixes for the runtime image support.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Fixed a bug in Execute External Program where using progressive
          output would not accurately set the exit status on error.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Check for the existence of the wizard before setting the title.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Only modify Command key bindings on OS X.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Don't check to see if the file is writable before we've checked to
          see if it exists.


2008-04-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added a parent method that was missing and a dummy name method for
          conditions to make them compliant with other tree objects.

    * lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the SetActiveSetupType API where it was not
          repopulating the components correctly.
           Added a new, powerful FindObjects API for locating just about
          anything in the system.


2008-03-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          The system default language will now be used as the default language
          in the installer if it is supported.  If the installer does not
          include the language for the user's system, the Default Language
          will be used in its place.


2008-03-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/utils.tcl, lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Added a new Editor external program preference to specify an editor
          to use when editing multi-line text.  InstallJammer will create a
          temporary file, execute the selected editor and watch for changes on
          the file and propagate them back into the project.

    * lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Re-enabled the Save as button for projects.  With the new Duplicate
          Project option, this shouldn't be nearly as confusing as before.
           Added a check when saving to see if the project file is writable. 
          If it's not, InstallJammer can attempt to make the file writable
          before saving at the user's request.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Brain fart.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Output the new width and height variables in the installer.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Added a new Watch Virtual Text property to allow matching of
          patterns without an actual virtual text variable in the pattern. 
          Regular expressions with less than two sub match patterns will use
          this variable as the default.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWrappedScript.action:
          Added new Include TWAPI property to the Install Wrapped Script
          action.  This allows wrapped scripts on the target system to include
          the TWAPI extension on Windows platforms.  The script will be
          automatically modified with a small header to load the TWAPI
          extension automatically.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added the ability to specify images in an installer at runtime. 
          Image properties can now contain a file on the build system, a file
          on the target system or an ID or Alias to a file stored within the
          installer.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Slight change to external editor behavior.  Allow for a %filename%
          to be specified on the command-line instead of always appending the
          file to the command string.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added a new Command Line Actions group that replaces the Setup
          Actions group in terms of location.  The Command Line Actions group
          executes before the command-line options have been parsed, and the
          Setup Actions group now executes after the command-line options have
          been parsed.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where checking conditions before the GuiMode variable
          had been initialized would cause an error.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/UnpackStoredFile.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the Unpack Stored File action would create the
          original install directory for the packed file by mistake.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/header.tcl:
          Added a new Test Component property to Panes, Actions and
          Conditions.  This property tells the (un)installer whether the given
          component should be executed when the installer is run in test mode.
           This allows to disabling things like license panels and other
          annoying things when a developer is testing.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/main.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Changed Test Component feature to Include with more options than
          just Yes or No.
          Rewrote some of the internals when dealing with properties that have
          lists of options.  These are now stored as integers instead of
          entire strings and then mapped in the code.  This should save some
          storage space in the installers.

    * lib/cmdline.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Added new --test-without-installing command-line build option to
          pass the --test option to the installer when testing.
           Made it legal to pass a directory on the command-line, and the
          builder will figure out which project file in the directory to use
          if it can.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action,
      lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/ExecuteScriptCondition.condition:
          Fixed a bug in the Execute Script action where returning a value
          would result in an error.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/convert.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          When a project is converted to a new version, it is now
          automatically saved, and a backup is made of the previous project
          file.

    * lib/file.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would not allow multiple directories with the same
          name to exist in a file group.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/init.tcl,
      Themes/Classic_Wizard/Uninstall/init.tcl,
      Themes/Classic_Wizard/theme.cfg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/init.tcl,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Uninstall/init.tcl, Themes/Modern_Wizard/theme.cfg,
      lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/themes.tcl:
          Added new Wizard Height and Wizard Width properties to the Install
          Features section.  These allow the developer to alter the size of
          the wizard during (un)installation.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/new.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Added a new Default Directory Location to the Project Preferences. 
          This property, if set, specifies the Location to use for all files
          and directories that are direct descendants of a file group if their
          own Location is not set.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Made builds more robust when we hit unexpected errors.  The errors
          should now go correctly to the build log, and the builder should go
          back to a known state so that the build can be tried again.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where multiple channels were opened to the debug log.


2008-03-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in shortcut actions where setting Command Line
          Properties did not propagate on UNIX platforms.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          The SetVirtualText API now recognizes update actions and commands on
          language-specific virtual text.  This allows tracking changes to
          language text.
           The SetVirtualText API's -language option now accepts the language
          code or full language name (en or English, etc...).

    * lib/common.tcl:
          The title of the installer and wizard are now specified in the
          InstallTitleText virtual text.  Both will update automatically
          anytime this virtual text changes.


2008-03-24  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/lang/hu.rc:
          Add Hungarian language file for BWidgets.

    * installjammer.com, installjammer.exe, lib/build.tcl, lib/cmdline.tcl,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Windows command-line builds are now done synchronously through a new
          installjamemr.com binary.  This will better allow scripting builds
          on the Windows platform.


2008-03-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where passing --temp on the command line would not
          actually set the Temp virtual text.
           Fixed a bug where attempting to paste an object with conditions
          would cause an error.
           Fixed several bugs with message boxes on non-Windows platforms.
           Fixed a bug and an inconsistency with the SpaceAvailable virtual
          text on non-Windows platforms.
           Fixed a bug where deleting objects from the system would not remove
          all of their virtual text from the project file.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Call PostCommonInit later in the startup process to allow the Temp
          virtual text to be set correctly before being used.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening a project from the right-click menu in the
          project list would result in an error.


2008-03-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the command-line builds that will allow better
          command-line behavior on Windows.


2008-03-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the build process for uninstalls that was due to the
          Setup Actions changes.


2008-03-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in ::InstallAPI::FindProcesses on Windows.
           Added a -glob argument to ::InstallAPI::FindProcesses (Windows-only
          currently).


2008-03-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where using tk_getOpenFile would error on non-Windows
          platforms.
           Installers will now focus on the Next button by default when moving
          panes.
           Fixed several bugs relating to "match any" conditions.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Minor changes to paths on different platforms.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/gui-osx.tcl, lib/gui-windows.tcl:
          When editing a property, clicking away from the property will now
          auto-save the property.  You no longer have to hit Return to save
          the change.  This may cause some problems with errors in properties.
          
          Cleaned up some of the platform GUI code.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening a choose directory dialog from a Windows
          network share would error out.
           Removed the entry box on the choose directory dialog.  Make New
          Folder is sufficient for specifying a folder name, and the entry was
          just confusing.

    * lib/BWidget/properties.tcl:
          Adding bindings for start, cancel and finish editing events.

    * lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action:
          Added new Require Response property to the Console Get User Input
          action.  This says that the user cannot provide an empty response
          and must give something.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/RegisterPackage.action:
          Added a Package Databases property to the Register Package action. 
          This allows the developer to specify that they only want to support
          RPM, DPKG or all package managers.  All is the default for backward
          compatibility.


2008-03-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed several bugs between setting Aliases of objects and their
          title in the component tree.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          We no longer source common.tcl since it's part of the startup.


2008-03-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that caused the Setup Actions group to never actually
          execute.


2008-03-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in ::InstallAPI::PromptForFile on Windows.


2008-03-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

          Fixed a bug where condition failure messages would pop up in the
          wrong place on some systems.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where symlink'd files on UNIX were being truncated once
          installed on Windows.
           Fixed a bug where a symlink'd directory would end up creating a
          recursive symlink on the target system during installation.


2008-02-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/preview.tcl:
          Fix a bug in preview.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action:
          Subst for aliases in the Pane property.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Modify Widget action where the parent could not
          be determined if the action was attached to a checkbutton or
          something else.


2008-02-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.5 RELEASED ***


2008-02-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/class.tcl:
          Added new Size property to Components.
          
           Added new Size property to File Groups.
          
           Added new Display Name property to Components.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added some new code to help get language-specific virtual text.

    * lib/convert.tcl:
          Unset the Size property of File Groups that was previously stored in
          the project file.  It was never seen by the user, and now the user
          can set it.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Open and Save project files with a utf-8 encoding so that non-ASCII
          text is automatically translated and made correct with each load and
          save.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Fixed a small GUI bug that was incorrectly populating text fields
          for Components.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Changes to facilitate the new Size properties for Components and
          File Groups.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Changes to facilitate the new Size properties for Components and
          File Groups.

    * lib/main.tcl:

          Added a new Encoding property to the Read File Into Virtual Text
          action.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Took a first whack at making sure the same file listed multiple
          times within the same file group are not counted or installed twice.
           The next step is to make sure that the same file doesn't get
          installed twice no matter what group it's in.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateSetupTypes.action:
          Check for a Display Name when populating components and setup types.
           If it's empty, use the standard name.

          widgets embedded in frames.
          
          Make sure that SetText handle framed widgets by searching for the
          first label widget and using that.


2008-01-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.4 RELEASED ***


2008-01-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed some minor bugs in the Choose Directory dialog.
           Added a check for illegal characters in a directory name.

    * lib/BWidget/tree.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in keyboard navigation in the choose directory dialog.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReadFileIntoVirtualText.action:
          Read File Into Virtual Text now reads files as text instead of
          binary by default.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Some minor cleanup.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/RemoveFromUninstall.action:
          Added new Remove From Uninstall action.

    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/ContinueWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/DeleteWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/PauseWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/StartWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/StopWindowsService.action:
          Added new actions to deal with Windows services.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Added checks for the new Remove from Uninstall action.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug in Modify Widget where modifying existing text
          properties was not modifying the text properly.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action:
          Fixed a bug where populating components with radiobuttons where no
          button was checked would make them all checked.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Installs are now built entirely to a temporary file and only renamed
          to their final location once the build has completely successfully. 
          This means that broken builds will not overwrite good installers
          that area already there.
           If a build fails with errors, it is now reported as having failed
          instead of completed.
           The files being packed are now shown as full paths instead of
          filenames.  This makes it easier to identify files within a build at
          the expense of some clutter.
           Building solid archives now shows packing log messages.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Reading project files no longer assumes a UTF-8 encoding.
           Added a new debugging command to turn debugging on and off more
          easily from the console as well as log debug information to a file.
           Fixed a bug where the WINDOWS virtual text was being reported
          incorrectly on some systems.  Despite my better judgment, we'll
          trust the environment variables.
           Browsing for a directory will now initialize to the current
          directory if it exists.
           Symbolic links are now created using the system 'ln -s'.  The
          built-in Tcl 'file link' command seems to be poorly thought out.
           Checking conditions can now have a boolean AND or OR instead of
          just always being AND.

    * lib/conditions.tcl:
          Added the ability to specify that conditions should be matched with
          an AND (Match all of the following) or an OR (Match any of the
          following).

    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Echo the full file path on progress.  Let the program decide what to
          do with it once it has it.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Added a Build Failure project preference to tell InstallJammer how
          to handle missing files when building from the GUI.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Added checks for the new Remove From Uninstall action.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added new ExecuteAction API call.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Set the default Build Failure property for new projects.

      Themes/Modern_Wizard/es.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/fr.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/pl.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg:
          Removed dummy license text from all but English translations so that
          a single license will display correctly in all languages.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg:
          Minor correction from translator.

    * ANNOUNCE.txt:
          Update ANNOUNCE.txt.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/convert.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Added a conversion for 1.2 because of the installkit
          incompatibilities.


2007-10-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReplaceTextInFile.action:
          Let Tcl translate the linefeeds when reading the a file and we'll
          handle writing.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/AdjustLineFeeds.action:
          Let Tcl translate the linefeeds when reading the a file and we'll
          handle writing.

    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action:
          Search for JDK directories on Windows.  This caused a bug where
          requiring JDK would always fail since they were never included in
          the search for Windows.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Use new procs for build and output directories.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Cleaned up GetText.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fix for command-line builds.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Call a command when the program folder changes.

    * ChangeLog, lib/main.tcl:
          Rewrote the command-line parsing procs.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          We don't need to call the modify proc if the program folder changes.
           Only if the all users value changes.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action:
          Install for All Users now accepts a null value which means to
          default to whatever the current default for the installer is.  This
          means to take whatever the value of <%ProgramFolder%> is instead of
          overriding it for all or the current user.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Added an editboolean property type.  This is an editable boolean
          showing Yes or No as options but also allowing for virtual text.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action:
          Install for All Users can now accept a virtual text.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action:
          Default Install for All Users to null.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallDesktopShortcut.action:
          Allow for virtual text in Install for All Users.
          
          Make default follow whatever is default for the program folder.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added <%COMMON_QUICK_LAUNCH%> virtual directory on Windows.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallDesktopShortcut.action:
          Fix.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Added --verbose command-line option.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Added --verbose command-line option.
          
          Removed superfluous code with regards to background builds.  All
          builds are done the same now.

    * lib/cmdline.tcl:
          Removed backgroundBuild variable.


2007-10-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Add AutoRefreshFile to reserved virtual text.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Remove quotes.  We don't need them.

    * lib/tclkit.tcl:
          Remove tclkit.tcl.  It hasn't been used in years.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Look for a double for progress bars instead of just an int.

    * lib/gui-osx.tcl:
          Remove images in menus.


2007-10-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug when finding symlinks.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Remember the pane settings for the main window.
          
          Added new project preference, Refresh File List Before Building,
          which
          is enabled by default.  This is the current behavior, but this can
          now
          be turned off, and the user can refresh on-demand.
          
          Added the Zip Archive platform.

    * lib/header.tcl:
          POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          
          Virtual text variables are no longer auto adjusted for boolean
          values.
          This was originally done to make checkbuttons easier, but it caused
          so
          many problems that it seems silly to make a case for something small
          like checkbuttons when the rest of the world suffers.
          
          Checkbuttons are now handled separately, and virtual text variables
          are not manipulated by InstallJammer when being read or written.

    * lib/help.tcl:
          Fix for OS X.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added EncodeURL API call.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          
          Rewrote the code that parses command-line arguments passed to
          InstallJammer.  This should only affect someone who is passing
          a VALUE of an argument that starts with --.  Otherwise, arguments
          should be parsed exactly as they were.
          
          The new method of parsing assumes that arguments are not necessarily
          delineated by a space.  Instead, the value of an option ends when
          either another option is found or we see -- which signifies the end
          of options.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Show comments on files and directories.

    * lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Fixed a bug with a missing variable.

    * ChangeLog:
          Committing ChangeLog.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in checkFileMethod.

    * lib/actions.tcl:
          Don't open action groups on a new project.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Don't open action groups on a new project.

          Encode any special characters in the URL before launching the
          browser.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action:

          Make sure we only add directories once.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:

          rough stages.

          Open new action groups for drag-and-drop

          Moved some code around to support the new Auto Refresh File Groups

          may have previously been there.

          This is a pretty massive commit.  I've been lazy with my commits
          lately.  Meh.
          
           lib/build.tcl
          Added new Fallback to Console platform property that allows an
          installer
          or uninstaller to fall back to a console install if the GUI
          initialization
          fails.
          
          Search for available packages in the project directory and in the
          lib/packages directory and include any found in the installer.
          
           lib/builderapi.tcl
          Added new ::BuilderAPI::ModifyObject command.
          
          Added new ::BuilderAPI::SetPlatformProperty command.
          
           lib/class.tcl
          Added new FallbackToConsole platform property for UNIX platforms
          that
          defaults to Yes.
          
           lib/common.tcl
          Check and set a variable if we're on Vista.
          
          Added new ScriptExt virtual text.
          
          Added new InstallRegistryInfo virtual text.
          
          When installing on Vista, always install program folder icons for
          all users.
          
          Added new InstallDirSuffix virtual text.
          
          Added new InstallDrive virtual text on Windows.
          
          If the Cancel button is disabled on a pane, the X button is also now
          disabled.
          
          Added new UpdateSelectedWidgets proc that will only update selected
          widgets.
          
          Fixed a bug that was severely slowing down the performance of
          requesting
          recursive children of an object.
          
          Added new FindUpdateWidgets proc that will take a list of virtual
          text
          and find all the widgets on the current pane that would actually use
          them.
          
          When an uninstall fails to remove a file for any reason, the
          uninstall
          will not delete itself on exit and instead populate itself with the
          information it needs to complete the uninstall on a subsequent run.
          
          Fixed a bug where Abort/Retry/Ignore message boxes would also end up
          with
          a No button.
          
          Record information about the command-line options passed in for use
          later.
          
          Fixed a bug where calling an installer with .. in the path would
          cause
          the installer to fail with the help usage.
          
          When exiting the installer, we will broadcast an event to Windows to
          update the registry environment if it has been changed during
          installation.
          
          Fixed a bug where a line of just the right width could go over when
          wrapping text in console mode.
          
          Subst the value the Target Filename if one exists for a value.
          
          Fixed a bug where conditions failing in console mode would cause an
          error.
          
           lib/conditions.tcl
          Action groups now have the same Check Condition values as actions.
          
           lib/convert.tcl
          Fixed a minor bug in the conversion of projects from 1.1b1 to 1.1.
          
           lib/edit.tcl
          Fixed a bug where pasting text would paste the same text twice.
          
           lib/editor.tcl
          Added the ability to specify a font when creating an edit window.
          
           lib/file.tcl
          Fixed a bug where cancelling the save when exiting the program could
          cause the builder to get into an unknown state where the title of
          the
          window would not be updated.
          
          Fixed a bug where aliases on files were not being written out to the
          installer, so files could not be referenced by their alias.
          
           lib/gui-common.tcl
          Added a new Fall Back to Console platform property for non-Windows
          platforms that tells InstallJammer to fall back to a console when
          the GUI initialization fails.
          
           lib/header.tcl
          Added the ability to add actions and commands to the udpate of
          virtual
          text so that a particular action or command could be called anytime
          a
          virtual text variable is updated.
          
           lib/install.tcl
          Fixed a bug in the calculation of required install size.
          
          Added a new InstallRegistryInfo variable that, if false, means that
          InstallJammer will not install information to a separate registry
          directory.  Instead, the uninstall information will be stored
          directly
          into the uninstaller itself.
          
          Fixed a bug where install messages were being wrongly output during
          a
          silent install.
          
          Greatly improved the performance of file installation on larger and
          longer-running installers.
          
          Fixed a bug where passing --prefix on the command-line while root
          would be ignored.
          
           lib/installapi.tcl
          Added new ::InstallAPI::ErrorMessage command to display errors.
          
          Fixed a bug where multiple calls to FetchURL with proxy arguments
          would continue to use the same proxy once set.
          
          Updated ::InstallAPI::FindProcesses to work on Windows using the
          TWAPI
          extension to find processes.
          
          Added new ::InstallAPI::SetObjectProperty command to set any
          property
          on an object.
          
          Added -action and -command arguments to ::InstallAPI::SetVirtualText
          to
          specify an action or command to execute whenever the specified
          virtual
          text is modified.
          
          Added new ::InstallAPI::URLIsValid command to validate a given URL.
          
           lib/main.tcl
          Fixed a bug where certain project files passed into the builder
          would
          not work.  The project file passed is now normalized before
          continuing on.
          
          Updated version to 1.2b2.
          
           lib/preview.tcl
          Fixed a bug that made previewing panes impossible on UNIX.
          
           lib/trees.tcl
          Allowed the re-ordering of acion groups in the bulider.
          
          Fixed a bug where re-ordering components wouldn't actually update
          their order during installation.
          
           lib/tress-filegroup.tcl
          Fixed a bug where source file locations were not always being
          substituted
          properly.
          
           lib/uninstall.tcl
          Uninstallers will now look for their uninstall information files
          from
          within themselves first before checking for a registry directory.
          
           lib/unpack.tcl
          Increased the speed of file installation by letting the unpack
          routines
          evaluate messages before passing them back to the installer and not
          passing any messages we don't have to.
          
           lib/utils.tcl
          The pane code editor is now a Courier 10 font.
          
          Changing the Alias of a pane, action or action group will not
          automatically update its title in the builder for easier
          recognition.
          
          When searching for Windows icons, the builder will now check the
          project
          directory first before looking in its own directory structure.
          
           lib/virtualtext.tcl
          Made ScriptExt a reserved virtual text.
          
           lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action
          Fixed a bug where the resulting user input would not be saved in the
          virtual text if the virtual text didn't exist to begin with.
          
           lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteAction.action
          Fixed a bug where if the action being executed was an action group,
          the action groups conditions would not be checked.
          
          Action groups now check conditions before to see if the action group
          should be executed and then after to see if the install should move
          forward or execute the whole action group again.
          
           lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
          Added new Include Stderr property to include the standard error
          channel
          on recorded output.
          
          When showing progressive output, we blank the text widget at the
          start
          of our action and then we tell InstallJammer not to automatically
          update
          this widget anymore, which means that the output from the program
          will
          not be erased as soon as the action is over.
          
          Fixed a bug where progressive output actions would never show that
          they
          had completed and thereby leave the installer in a frozen state.
          
          Changed the mapping for Windows output so that the text looks right
          in
          a progressive output widget.
          
          Show progressive output even in console mode.
          
           lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action
          Changed the text editor for the Tcl Script property to a fixed font.
          
           lib/Actions/FileActions/UnzipFile.action
          Added Progressive Virtual Text property to specify a virtual text
          variable to update with the percentage complete as the files are
          unzipped.
          
          Added Status Virtual Text property to specify a virtual text
          variable
          to update with a progressive status as the files are unzipped.
          
          Fixed a bug where multiple calls to this action would actually stack
          up
          the files and continue to unpack previous files into other
          locations.
          
           lib/Actions/GeneralActions/SetObjectProperty.action
          Added new Set Object Property action to set properties on objects.
          
           lib/Actions/GeneralActions/TextWindow.action
          Make sure that the Text Window action only executes in GUI mode.
          
           lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
          Made rollback on cancelled installs a lot cleaner and faster.
          
          Moved the update Windows registry call to the end of the install.
          
           lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action
          The uninstaller no longer adds itself to the list of files to be
          uninstalled.  It will automatically remove itself when appropriate
          during uninstallation.
          
           lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action
          Added new Add to Uninstall property to specify that the new path
          added should be removed automatically during uninstallation.
          
          Updated this action to work on UNIX platforms.
          
           lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action
          New action to add environment variables.  This works for all
          platforms.
          
           lib/Actions/SystemActions/DeleteEnvironmentVariable.action
          New action to delete environment variables.  This works only on
          Windows.
          
           lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
          If we fail to remove all of the files for any reason, the uninstall
          will remain on the system for later removal.
          
          Added routines to remove environment variables that are added during
          installation.
          
          Added routines to remove paths from directory environment variables
          that are added during installation.
          
           lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action
          Fixed a bug where registry keys that were added to the uninstall
          were
          not being removed properly.
          
           lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action
          Added new Action property to specify an action to be executed
          whenever
          the user clicks a button or modifies a radiobutton or checkbutton.
          
          Added new "button" type to create buttons on a pane.
          
           lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action
          Fixed a bug that would cause component population on a screen to act
          very weird when moving back and forth through an installation. 
          Components
          that were inactive used to be excluded from the shown list, but
          since
          IJ marks components as inactive when they are unchecked, this would
          cause
          them to disappear on subsequent runs.
          
          Now, the only way to get a component to not show up is by setting
          its
          ShowComponent property to false.  This can be done with the new API
          call or by the new Set Object Property action.
          
           lib/Conditions/FileConditions/FilePermissionCondition.condition
          Fixed a bug where installing to a root drive on Windows could cause
          an infinite loop to occur when validating that directory.
          
           lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/ObjectTestCondition.condition
          Added new operators: "does not exist" and "exists" to the Object
          Test
          Condition.
          
           lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/VirtualTextTestCondition.condition
          Added new "was set from the command line" operator to the Virtual
          Text
          Test condition that will test whether the given virtual text was set
          by any option from the command line.
          
           lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/CommandLineTest.condition
          Added new Command Line Test condition to test the options passed on
          the
          command line.
